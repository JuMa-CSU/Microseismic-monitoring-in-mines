JUST KEEP THIS IMS_ASCII2MSEED.py IN THE SAME FOLDER WITH YOUR IMS_ASCII DATA AND 
ENSURE THAT THE FOLDER IS NAMED 'ASCII'. ALL THE IMS_ASCII DATA WILL BE CONVERTED
TO MINISEED FOMATE AFTER YOU RUN THE SCUPIT. THE OUTPUT WILL BE STORED IN 'MSEED' FOLDER.

Requires:ascii2mseed(IRIS SeisCode) should be installed on your computer.
In most environments a simple 'make' will build the program.
Don't forget copy the executable ascii2mseed file to /usr/bin/.
